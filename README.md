# Title: To-Do List App

## Description: 
- The web app is a to-do list application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks using Flask and PyMongo. The app includes three main directories: "Home Page", "All Tasks", and "Create a Task". 
- On the Home Page, users can see the number of tasks they have, as well as a list of important tasks. Also, we changed the color and decorated the home page.
- On the “All Tasks” page, all ongoing tasks are displayed, including their name, description, priority, and time created. Users can edit or delete individual tasks using links next to each task, or delete all tasks at once by clicking on "Delete All".
- On "Create a Task" page allows users to create new tasks by submitting a form with a task name, priority, and description. The app uses priority levels to help users prioritize their tasks, and important tasks are displayed prominently on the Home Page.
